            "p": "SINGAPORE: Less than two months after first proposing a 21 per cent global minimum corporate tax rate, on May 20, the US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen floated the idea of a lower rate of 15 per cent.\nShe emphasised, however, that this was a floor rate and that a higher rate was still being contemplated and negotiated.\nThis more realistic rate is likely to gain increased support from other countries and build on momentum on a growing consensus for a global minimum corporate tax rate.\nThis announcement comes on the back of ongoing discussions under the OECD project on taxation of the digital economy, colloquially known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0, aimed at combatting tax-planning strategies used by some multinational corporations (MNCs) to avoid taxes.

            "p": "France and Germany, already early supporters of the initially proposed 21 per cent rate, have been quick to endorse the latest US move as well, hailing it as a “good compromise” and a “big progress”.\nThe move comes before a meeting of the G7 countries in London next month where the new 15 per cent rate could see more support.\nNot everyone has warmed up to the idea though. The initial 21 per cent rate had faced strong resistance from low-tax European countries like Ireland from the time the idea was mooted.\nAt home, the Republicans are expected to oppose the Biden administration’s tax proposals, whether it is the watered-down global minimum rate of 15 per cent or the proposed increase in the domestic US corporate tax rate to 28 per cent. \nAdmittedly, it was clever politics on the part of the US to attempt to first gain support from the international community on the global minimum rate in order to increase its chance of success on its domestic tax plan. \nHowever, to gain acceptance, its proposed 28 per cent domestic corporate tax rate may also have to be reduced, for example, to 25 per cent to match UK’s proposed rate from 2023.
