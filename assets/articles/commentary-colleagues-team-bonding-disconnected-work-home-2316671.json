Their analysis showed that even such team interactions have since started to diminish.\nMany of us just don’t really feel like part of a team anymore."

            "p": "Innovation is the lifeblood of companies. We know that when people come together - to brainstorm, meet deadlines, or even share a joke – they hit on ways to solve problems and improve things. And companies flourish.\nIt’s for this reason Steve Jobs filled Apple’s Cupertino headquarters with large spaces and meeting nooks to maximise chance encounters and casual discussions.\nHas remote working killed team spirit? Sixteen per cent of Gen Z employees said they struggled with bringing new ideas, getting a word in during meetings, or feeling engaged about work, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index survey in January 2021.\nAnother Microsoft-commissioned study found European business leaders reported a decrease in innovation, possibly because it’s difficult for ideas to thrive when teammates feel disconnected from each other.\nAs one of the researchers put it: “When you lose connections, you stop innovating”.\nPerhaps we took team bonding somewhat for granted before the coronavirus hit. We had plenty of opportunities for informal bonding in an office with face-to-face interactions where we pick up on social cues and conversational nuances.\nAccording to pioneering research in the 1960s by psychologist Albert Mehrabian, at least 70 per cent of all communication is nonverbal. So it’s not surprising virtual conversations feel transactional and less spontaneous.\nAnd who can forget those mandatory corporate team bonding events? They might seem contrived or superficial, but such activities let employees learn the best ways to communicate with our colleagues.\nTeammates create shared experiences and references through non-work conversations – even in an escape room or craft workshop. Camaraderie gives us a sense of purpose and belonging.\nBased on the research at MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory, socialisation can account for more than 50 per cent of “positive changes in communication patterns”."

            "p": "So the challenge in a hybrid work reality is: How to foster social connections across teammates of different age groups, work experiences, levels of digital skills and home situations? And without encroaching in our already-blurred work-life situation?\nFor now, companies have had little choice but to engage teams virtually. So leaders must be deliberate about finding ways to spark informal interactions among employees.\nOne way is to leave a part of weekly meetings agenda-free or hold virtual coffee or “fireside” chats without any structured content to create a space for less formal interactions within teams.\nAt GitLab, a software company that remarkably has been working remotely since it started in 2014, employees can take “virtual coffee breaks” with colleagues over Slack.\nThey even use a bot called Donut to pair random teammates for coffee breaks, to capture the serendipity of the watercooler moment.\nThe Android Trello app’s engineering team meets for lunch over videoconferencing once a month and can claim up to US$25 to eat out, order in or even cook up a storm.\nManagers at professional services company Deloitte Singapore are encouraged to organise something to “energise everybody at the start of the day”, such as online yoga sessions.\nPrudential Singapore also has a “Focused Friday” since 2019, encouraging employees not to arrange afternoon meetings and use the time instead to focus on learning, innovation or personal wellness.\nThe trick looks to be this: Being deliberate and disciplined about setting aside time to form new virtual rituals and replace the in-person ones we’ve lost."

            "p": "In my experience speaking to HR leaders across the region, there is one clear consensus - nothing beats physical interaction. A LinkedIn poll I recently did showed employees preferred the same.\nHumans crave connection and we do it best in person, especially after a prolonged period of restrictions without a clear view of the end of the tunnel.\nIf and when employees return to the office with some caution, leaders must be equally deliberate in creating opportunities for physical meetups.\nWhat works is when activities are truly independent of work. It signals to employees they are allowed to slow down, forget about deadlines and organisational charts to focus on building genuine connections.\nOne pre-pandemic experience I recall was a tea appreciation session. I started out sceptical at first but ended up thoroughly enjoying the deep conversations and getting to know my colleagues more than I ever could at work."
        },
        {
            "p": "If leaders are insincere in helping teams, you can bet employees sense it immediately.\nEmployees may feel obligated to turn up, to avoid looking bad or being passed over for recognition later, but they’ll just get the activities over and done with – a waste of time and opportunities for actual bonding.\nGood organisations stand out because they take the time to understand their employees’ needs – the introverted ones may be more energised by remote working, while the extroverted can’t wait to see everyone back in the office.\nSo, though Singapore maintains restrictions on large gatherings and a default work-from-home arrangement for now, all hope is not lost.\nTaken with some optimism, it means companies and leaders still have time to plan for our hybrid work future. They can refine efforts to help teams bond virtually now and consider how to find the right balance with physical interactions when the time finally comes."
