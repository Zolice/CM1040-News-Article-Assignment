            "p": "However, the cessation of corporate income tax rebates this year after seven successful years arising mostly from the Transition Support Package launched in 2013 to aid businesses in restructuring means that companies will generally pay higher taxes for the same amount of taxable income earned in 2020 compared to previous years. \nThis bodes well for corporate income tax collection for FY2021, projected to increase to S$18 billion after having dipping from S$16.7 billion in FY2019 to S$13.7 billion in FY2020 due to lower profits and losses sustained as a result of the pandemic. \nPutting aside Net Investment Returns Contribution, corporate income tax collection has consistently generated the most revenue for the Government for many years.\nHowever, this reliable revenue base may be eroded should international tax rules determining how taxing rights are allocated among jurisdictions change as a result of ongoing discussions under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).\nGlobal companies may no longer find it attractive to locate their operations in Singapore consequently.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty now in determining how badly Singapore will be impacted if these happen."

Singaporeans have not only seen incomes go up but are also paying their fair share for national development. \nStill, there may be scope for the structure to be more progressive in the near future by introducing a higher tax rate above 22 per cent for ultra-high income earners.\nSome might ask, wouldn’t the forthcoming goods and services (GST) hike take care of that? The answer is yes but only to a certain extent.\nIndeed, the next highest revenue generator after both types of income taxes is GST. \nSimilar to corporate income tax, GST revenue dipped from S$11.2 billion in FY2019 to S$9.9 billion in FY2020 likely due to the pandemic’s dampening effect on consumption.\nGST collection has been projected to be somewhat restored to S$11.3 billion in FY2021 as the economy recovers and spending increases. \nIndeed, collected GST revenue may improve with the introduction of GST on low-value goods imported via air and post as well as on consumer imported non-digital services (including educational learning and fitness training) from 2023. \nShould the economy recover this year at the higher end of the 4 to 6 per cent projected growth, DPM Heng may well decide to effect the GST hike sooner rather than later sometime from 2022 to 2025."

Budget 2021 has some answers.\nInterestingly, this year’s Budget paved the way for the Government to use long-term bonds to fund infrastructure projects, under a Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act to be debated in Parliament. \nThis is a fair way to do so as the direct beneficiaries of improved infrastructure bear the responsibility of funding these projects.\nThis approach also smoothens out the lumpy expenditure for MRT lines and the building of coastal defences over many years, assuming there is a robust process to select less risky infrastructure projects suitable to be financed with bonds of an appropriate tenure.\nSuch an approach is prudent considering the global economy may be in a low-interest-rate environment for some years to come though the question remains what safeguards may be in place to manage the risk of interest rates going up.
