            <em class="mb-4">What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you
                choose to implement?</em>
            <p class="m-0">For this project, I have created a fictional news website, which writes news articles for
                everyone to read. In this news website, news articles are written by the journalists and posted on the
                website for public viewing. To achieve this general news website, I used a generic article structure for
                writing articles itself, to ensure that it can be used for any article genres and/or topic.
                <br><br>The name of this fictional news website is called "Newsforest", which is chosen as it implies a
                wealth of information and knowledge, much like a forest is full of different types of trees and plants.
                The name suggests that the website is a source of a wide variety of news stories and articles, providing
                readers with a diverse and rich selection of content to choose from.
                <br><br>The logo design features a stylized tree made up of the letters "N" and "F" to represent the
                name "Newsforest". The tree is surrounded by a circle to symbolize unity and the idea of a central
                source for news and information. The green colour represents growth, renewal, and the natural world,
                while the brown colour conveys strength and reliability.
                <br><br>In this fictional website, their mission is to provide a comprehensive source of news and
                information to our readers. As the name suggests, “Newsforest” offers a diverse and rich selection of
                content on a range of topics, much like a forest is full of different trees and plants.
                <br><br>“Newsforest” believes in the power of journalism to inform, engage, and empower their readers,
                and strive to deliver high-quality journalism that reflects the values of our community. Newsforest
                provides insightful and informative coverage that helps our readers make sense of the world around them.
                <br><br>Regarding the structure of the website, for the main page, the website is greeted with a hero
                image on the top depicting a racoon clinging on to a tree in a forest. Below it, the news headlines and
                highlights are shown in a carousel. Further below, recent articles are displayed in a list view. All of
                these articles from the carousel and the list can be clicked on and will redirect the user to the
                article displayed.
                <br><br>Additionally, in the article page, the author’s name and profile picture is displayed on the
                right side of the screen. You can click on the author to be redirected to the author’s page, where a
                short description and their recent articles can be viewed.
                <br><br>Most of the above information can be found in the `README.md` file attached with this project.
                Additionally, I have committed this project’s code into a <a
                    href="https://github.com/Zolice/CM1040-News-Article-Assignment">GitHub Repository</a> as well. I
                will make the <a href="https://github.com/Zolice/CM1040-News-Article-Assignment">GitHub Repository</a>
                public a week after this project is due.

            <h2 class="m-0">Inspiration</h2>
            <em class="mb-4">State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers,
                websites, artists, blogs). </em>
            <p class="m-0">For the design of the webpage, I was inspired by the image of the racoon clinging on to the
                tree. Using the image, I utilized the colour green for the border of the header bar. Additionally, the
                image also inspired the design of the logo that I created for the webpage. The logo was created using <a
                    href="https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>, which is used in the
                header, footer, and webpage icon. The description of the logo’s symbolism can be found in the
                Introduction paragraph above, as well as in the about page in the website.
                <br><br>To mimic the article page, I started taking articles and pasting them into a plain Microsoft
                Office Word Document and playing around with the various font sizes and line spacing to figure out what
                I wanted for my article page. Reading articles from The Straits Times also helped to give me a better
                idea of what elements were needed, as well as their layout. Later, I then utilized Figma to draw it into
                a wireframe, including elements such as images and headers. This design is then used for the website
                itself.
                <br><br>Additionally, I took reference from the Wild Wild Wet theme park website, where they had a
                carousel display. Although the carousel featured on the website was not automatic scrolling, I really
                liked the idea behind it, and wanted to use the carousel to display news articles on the website. On top
                of the carousel, I added a grid below it to display other news highlights that could be featured.

                    The use of such landmarks allows screen readers to better identify important regions of the website,
                    and areas that a screen reader can use. By doing so, this will help the visually impaired to use the

                <h3 class="m-0">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
                <p>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design is defined as to keep irrelevant information away from the
                    interfaces, to put the main content of the website focused on the essentials. (Nielsen, 1994)
                    <br><br>As such, in the Index page, irrelevant details such as the newspaper’s details have been
                    moved to the About Us page. Doing so moves the focus to the news articles listed in the Index page,
                    keeping the users distracted from other unnecessary elements. The About Us page can be accessed from
                    the Header or the Footer.
                    <br><br>In the Article page, the Social Media Feed has been removed from the right side, allowing
                    the user to focus solely on the article and its content.

                <h3 class="m-0">Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h3>
                <p>This website uses URL Parameters to fetch and display the articles to the user. However, in the case
                    whereby the URL Parameters are invalid, the website is unable to find and display the article
                    requested. This would commonly be recognized as an Error 404, where a file is not found. As such,
                    the website would redirect the users to an Error 404 page.
                    <br><br>To help the users understand the error better, the website gives some basic information
                    regarding the error. The website also automatically redirects the user to the Index page after 10
                    seconds, for them to find another article to view.

                <p>The definition of Consistency and Standards refers to maintaining consistency within a single product
                    or a family of products. (Nielsen, 1994) In simple terms, a user should not feel confused when using
                    my website, and should meet the users’ normal expectations.
                    <br><br>Taking an example, a user commonly expects the headlines of a news website to be displayed
                    with large images and text. This is also done in my website, and is accompanied with a carousel as
                    well to rotate between a few headlines.

                <h3 class="m-0">jQuery</h3>
                <p>In this project, I wanted to add some form of modularity to the website, by separating the Header,
                    Footer, Social Media elements, amongst many other elements, from the main .html file. By separating
                    them I will be able to code these elements individually. If I had to make any changes to it, I am
                    able to edit just these individual elements’ file. I will not need to edit them in every single
                    webpage html file.
                    <br><br>To do so, I utilized jQuery, a JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation. Using jQuery, I
                    was able to load the individual elements from their separate html files, into the main webpages html
                    file. Additionally, in an attempt to separate elements from the main html file, I utilized jQuery to
                    load the templates of articles, the carousel news highlights etc. This further separated elements
                    from the main webpage html.
                    <br><br>jQuery is a very useful tool, and I will consider using it in my future website projects.

            </div>
            <div class="group-1">
                <h3 class="m-0">Carousel</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, I wanted to add a carousel for the news highlights to the webpage. I took this
                    as a challenge to learn and debug it by myself.
                    <br><br>It took me awhile to figure out a way to make this work, which was to use 3 layers of grids
                    on the same area, in order to display the carousel buttons on top of the carousel’s content. This
                    was later fine tuned into 2 layers as I felt that the original method was not optimal. The 1st layer
                    is used to hold the left, right buttons as well as the buttons on the bottom of it, while the 2nd
                    layer is used to hold the article headers on top of the article image, as the content of the
                    carousel.
                    <br><br>For some reason when doing the Carousel, I forgot to complete the code for the carousel’s
                    index buttons. Only a week later when testing the website did I notice it. This took me
                    approximately half an hour to resolve.
                    <br><br>Despite all the frustration with making my own carousel from scratch, I felt that it was a
                    meaningful experience, which helped me to better understand DOM manipulation using JavaScript, and
                    animating using CSS.

            <div class="group-1">
                <h3 class="m-0">Handlebars and Articles</h3>
                <p>In the middle of this module, we were taught to use Handlebars and Mustache, to create templates and
                    fill it with information to push into the website. Doing so made duplicating similarly structured
                    elements a lot simpler. Note that Handlebars and Mustache both offered very similar features, and I
                    had chosen to use Handlebars for this project.
                    <br><br>Most of my articles were compiled into JSON objects, and I was able to use it to populate
                    the article pages as well as news lists using those. But due to the simplicity of certain elements
                    such as the headers and paragraphs, they did not justify the need of making a template just for it.
                    As such, for some of the elements, I took the content and updated it directly using pure JavaScript
                    DOM, without the use of Handlebars.
                    <br><br>Handlebars is a very useful tool that can simplify certain repeated workflows. It should be
                    considered when making any website.

            <h2 class="m-0">Evaluation I</h2>
            <em class="mb-4">What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why? </em>
            <p class="m-0">In this project, I am very proud of my use of jQuery to introduce modularity into this
                website, and I believe that it is a great success. As mentioned above, jQuery allowed me to split
                specific elements and templates into their own html files, separated from the main html files. This
                allows me to modify the header.html file, and its changes will be reflected accordingly across all web
                pages that use it.
                <br><br>On another topic regarding the articles, due to the limitations of the project, I was only
                allowed to create a maximum of 5 pages for this project. This would make it almost impossible to
                hard-code more than 5 articles into this project. As a workaround, I compiled multiple articles,
                collected from CNA, into a JSON variable, and utilized Handlebars and JavaScript DOM to update the
                webpage based on the link parameters. This is also mentioned above. With this implementation, I was able
                to fit 12 different articles into this website, while maintaining the page count. This also freed up the
                page count, allowing me to add an error page to redirect users, in the case whereby they might have
                keyed in a wrong URL. As such, I find that this is very successful.

                mobile view for the news highlights looks too big and chunky.
                <br><br>I would consider having only 1 headline to display, and display other highlighted news on the
                side in a carousel. I will also display recent articles below the headline.
