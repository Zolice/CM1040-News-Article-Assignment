The name of the website is called "Newsforest", which is chosen as it implies a wealth of information and knowledge, must like a forest is full of different types of trees and plants. The name suggests that the website is a source of wide variety of news stories and articles, providing readers with a diverse and rich selection of content to choose from. 

The logo design features a stylized tree made up of the letters "N" and "F" to represent the name "Newsforest". The tree is surrounded by a circle to symbolize unity and the idea of a central source for news and information. The green colour represents growth, renewal, and the natural world, while the brown colour conveys strength and reliability.
