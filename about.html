                <p class="m-0">The name of the website is called "Newsforest", which is chosen as it implies a
                    wealth of information and knowledge, must like a forest is full of different types of trees and
                    plants. The name suggests that the website is a source of wide variety of news stories and
                    articles, providing readers with a diverse and rich selection of content to choose from.
                    <br><br>The logo design features a stylized tree made up of the letters "N" and "F" to represent
                    the name "Newsforest". The tree is surrounded by a circle to symbolize unity and the idea of a
                    central source for news and information. The green colour represents growth, renewal, and the
                    natural world, while the brown colour conveys strength and reliability.
                </p>
