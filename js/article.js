Singaporeans have not only seen incomes go up but are also paying their fair share for national development. \nStill, there may be scope for the structure to be more progressive in the near future by introducing a higher tax rate above 22 per cent for ultra-high income earners.\nSome might ask, wouldn’t the forthcoming goods and services (GST) hike take care of that? The answer is yes but only to a certain extent.\nIndeed, the next highest revenue generator after both types of income taxes is GST. \nSimilar to corporate income tax, GST revenue dipped from S$11.2 billion in FY2019 to S$9.9 billion in FY2020 likely due to the pandemic’s dampening effect on consumption.\nGST collection has been projected to be somewhat restored to S$11.3 billion in FY2021 as the economy recovers and spending increases. \nIndeed, collected GST revenue may improve with the introduction of GST on low-value goods imported via air and post as well as on consumer imported non-digital services (including educational learning and fitness training) from 2023. \nShould the economy recover this year at the higher end of the 4 to 6 per cent projected growth, DPM Heng may well decide to effect the GST hike sooner rather than later sometime from 2022 to 2025."

Their analysis showed that even such team interactions have since started to diminish.\nMany of us just don’t really feel like part of a team anymore."

We know that when people come together - to brainstorm, meet deadlines, or even share a joke – they hit on ways to solve problems and improve things. And companies flourish.\nIt’s for this reason Steve Jobs filled Apple’s Cupertino headquarters with large spaces and meeting nooks to maximise chance encounters and casual discussions.\nHas remote working killed team spirit? Sixteen per cent of Gen Z employees said they struggled with bringing new ideas, getting a word in during meetings, or feeling engaged about work, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index survey in January 2021.\nAnother Microsoft-commissioned study found European business leaders reported a decrease in innovation, possibly because it’s difficult for ideas to thrive when teammates feel disconnected from each other.\nAs one of the researchers put it: “When you lose connections, you stop innovating”.\nPerhaps we took team bonding somewhat for granted before the coronavirus hit. We had plenty of opportunities for informal bonding in an office with face-to-face interactions where we pick up on social cues and conversational nuances.\nAccording to pioneering research in the 1960s by psychologist Albert Mehrabian, at least 70 per cent of all communication is nonverbal. So it’s not surprising virtual conversations feel transactional and less spontaneous.\nAnd who can forget those mandatory corporate team bonding events? They might seem contrived or superficial, but such activities let employees learn the best ways to communicate with our colleagues.\nTeammates create shared experiences and references through non-work conversations – even in an escape room or craft workshop. Camaraderie gives us a sense of purpose and belonging.\nBased on the research at MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory, socialisation can account for more than 50 per cent of “positive changes in communication patterns”."

And without encroaching in our already-blurred work-life situation?\nFor now, companies have had little choice but to engage teams virtually. So leaders must be deliberate about finding ways to spark informal interactions among employees.\nOne way is to leave a part of weekly meetings agenda-free or hold virtual coffee or “fireside” chats without any structured content to create a space for less formal interactions within teams.\nAt GitLab, a software company that remarkably has been working remotely since it started in 2014, employees can take “virtual coffee breaks” with colleagues over Slack.\nThey even use a bot called Donut to pair random teammates for coffee breaks, to capture the serendipity of the watercooler moment.\nThe Android Trello app’s engineering team meets for lunch over videoconferencing once a month and can claim up to US$25 to eat out, order in or even cook up a storm.\nManagers at professional services company Deloitte Singapore are encouraged to organise something to “energise everybody at the start of the day”, such as online yoga sessions.\nPrudential Singapore also has a “Focused Friday” since 2019, encouraging employees not to arrange afternoon meetings and use the time instead to focus on learning, innovation or personal wellness.\nThe trick looks to be this: Being deliberate and disciplined about setting aside time to form new virtual rituals and replace the in-person ones we’ve lost."

It signals to employees they are allowed to slow down, forget about deadlines and organisational charts to focus on building genuine connections.\nOne pre-pandemic experience I recall was a tea appreciation session. I started out sceptical at first but ended up thoroughly enjoying the deep conversations and getting to know my colleagues more than I ever could at work."

They can refine efforts to help teams bond virtually now and consider how to find the right balance with physical interactions when the time finally comes."

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year message that the Government will have to “start moving” on the hike in Budget 2022.\nBut it comes at a time of concern about rising costs of living, amid financial woes from the pandemic and Singapore’s headline inflation for December 2021 hitting a near nine-year high.\nSince the less well-off pay more GST as a percentage of their income than high-earners, perhaps the bigger question around this hike is this: Can we make GST less regressive?\nMore specifically, some people are asking if having different GST rates for essential and non-essential goods can help lessen the impact of the hike on Singaporeans."

                "p": "The reasoning goes, that everyone must buy “must-have” items which should be kept affordable, while the higher-income have room for discretionary spending on “good-to-haves” that could be taxed more.\nSome countries, in fact, treat certain basic necessities as exempt supplies, including Asian countries such as India, Indonesia and South Korea, or subject them to a reduced GST rate compared to the standard rate. Foodstuffs, for example, are taxed at 5.5 per cent instead of 20 per cent in France, or zero-rated instead of 10 per cent in Australia.\nLike Singapore, New Zealand charges a broad-based 15 per cent GST, and basic necessities are treated as taxable standard-rated supplies.\nIn Singapore, the Government has long resisted this move to treat basic necessities as exempt supplies since GST was first implemented in 1994. It opted instead for a broad-based system with very few exemptions that do not include food or healthcare.\nThe Government’s rationale is that exempting basic necessities from GST will help everyone but end up benefitting the wealthy more as they spend more.\nInstead, it considers it a fairer approach to target assistance for lower- and middle-income households through measures like GST vouchers and absorbing GST for healthcare services consumed by subsidised patients. A S$6 billion Assurance Package was also announced to offset the upcoming hike for five to 10 years.\nIt is unclear how much a zero or reduced GST rate might affect tax revenue and hinder the Government’s ability to finance targeted assistance schemes, or to fund the increased public spending that motivated the hike in the first place.\nA shortfall might mean the GST rate could be raised again in future or offsets that can be channelled to help the less well-off could be lower.\nCounterintuitive as it may seem, a lower tax rate for certain goods and services may backfire in its goal of helping lower-income households."

Roasted nuts are zero-rated if unshelled but draw a 20 per cent standard rate if shelled for example.\nSome goods and services may also run up against the issue of fairness: Women in Germany used to fork out 19 per cent tax on sanitary products, the so-called “tampon tax” that categorised them as luxury items.\nThe law must be clear in defining the basket of goods in each GST category. Disagreement between tax authorities and taxpayers may lead to classification issues and potential legal disputes that can only be settled in the courts.\nMultiple GST rates may be confusing, if certain goods and services potentially fall under different classifications. Imagine: If biscuits are charged 10 per cent GST while chocolates are charged 20 per cent, then what would the GST rate for a bar of KitKat be?\nA single-rate system will also be simpler for both authorities to administer and businesses to comply with. Mechanisms needed for a multi-rate system also have a compliance cost that may end up being passed on to consumers instead.\nThe red tape of administrative bottleneck and potential legal disputes can impede collection of the GST and consequently hinder any economic activity."

It will not squeeze the lower- and middle-income.\nSpecific application of GST on such properties would thus be in the same spirit as differentiating essential from luxury goods, compared to property taxes or Buyers’ Stamp Duty that have been revised in the recent past and for which there might be less appetite to revise so soon again.\nGiven the necessity of the GST increase to shore up Singapore’s revenues, such bold moves might be simpler and more helpful than a complicated multi-rate GST system."

Our national Budget has not been spared either. \nThere are some exceptions but with a collapsed world economy, tourism and domestic demand, many companies will see lower profit margins, leading to shortfalls in projected taxes and other forms of government revenues.\nWhile Singapore’s GDP is expected to grow by 4 to 6 per cent this year according to the Trade and Industry Ministry, firms and households expect support from the Government given the poor outlook.\nThe timing of the GST hike will very much depend on the pandemic situation, which is still very fluid.\nGlobal vaccinations are progressing slower than expected, as advanced countries grapple with the need to ramp up healthcare delivery systems.\nWorse, we are still witnessing record infections in many countries including Malaysia, Japan and the US, where fresh curbs have been slapped on.\nFar from flattening the curve, the seven-day average of new daily global cases have been up an uptrend, reaching new highs this month of almost 800,000.\nThere are also remaining uncertainties including whether the COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission, how long immunity lasts and how long more international borders will stay shut if new waves of infections continue."

He emphasised the need to fund broad–based increases in recurrent health spending, signalling that a responsible government should have “the discipline to raise revenue in a timely manner”.\nI expect him to continue this prudent stance but take a calibrated approach to defer the GST hike until 2023, since the COVID-19 situation is unlikely to improve drastically by Budget Day on Feb 16. \nBut he may take a leaf from his earlier book to announce then the implementation date of the 2 per cent hike in 2023 to prepare the public for this hard decision.\n­Delaying the hike further until 2024 or 2025 will seriously weaken Singapore’s fiscal position.  The Government is expected to chalk up a record deficit of about S$50 billion or more in the 2020 fiscal year - the first year of a new term of government - substantially funded from drawing down past reserves.\nBoth corporate, individual income taxes and GST, are expected to dip in the near term, so long as these tax rates remain unchanged. \nMeanwhile, recurring expenditures, especially healthcare spending, are expected to surge. Healthcare has already risen by 11 per cent annually from 2012 to 2017.  This increase itself is expected to exceed the projected additional revenue from a 2 per cent GST hike and it would not be right to use past reserves to fund recurring expenditure.\nA 2 percentage point GST hike will raise additional government revenue of about 0.7 per cent of GDP per year, DPM Heng had pointed out in 2018. \nA phased increase is more palatable to consumers but creates additional compliance hassle for firms already grappling with the challenges wrought by COVID-19 who must make the adjustments twice."

Among all the bad news, the property market has proven to be surprisingly resilient, suggesting the market has huge liquidity.\nThe cooling measures over 2013, 2018 and more recent changes might have tempered speculation, putting the market on stronger footing. This strong performance by the property market suggests this sector may provide a strong tax base should the Government decide to raise wealth taxes rather than income tax.\nSingapore's local property market is \"starting to see renewed positive sentiments and some gathering of momentum in prices\", DPM Heng had said on Monday, sparking speculation of more cooling measures.\n\"We do not want to see the property market run ahead of the underlying economic fundamentals,\" he added.\nThere is scope to tax the property market to these ends.

This measure should not affect Singaporeans in the lower- and middle-income groups.\nSome people have argued to bring back estate duties, removed after 2008.\nFor deaths prior to this date, estate tax was payable on the principal value of property passed onto beneficiaries, subject to exemptions of S$9 million for residential properties and S$600,000 for non-residential assets. \nIf the Government does so, it would be for tax progressiveness rather than fiscal need, given the small amount of taxes collected, the small number of taxpayer base and the fact that it is easy for the ultra-rich to significantly reduce this tax through tax planning.  \nNobody likes taxes, not even Ministers for Finance, as DPM Heng put it. \nBut of all the options available, GST, the fourth largest contributor to government revenue after Net Investment Returns Contribution, corporate and personal income taxes, remains the best one."

They encourage their workers to mingle around more often. Why? They know that their employees spend most of their time at work and lack time to socialise outside work.

Take Barack and Michelle Obama, who met while working at a law firm in 1989. \nOf the office romances I’ve personally been around, the couples have always displayed a high level of professionalism that allowed for a harmonious relationship between them and other colleagues in the workplace. \nFor example, in one of my previous jobs at a Singapore listed company, there was a newsletter issue that featured married couples in the office. It was very heart-warming. Even though some of those couples worked together in the same department, they handled things professionally while collaborating effectively at work. \nThe right question to ask about office romances, perhaps, should not be about whether it’s right to date a co-worker, but rather, what the rules of the game are and how you should or should not act while in a romantic relationship with someone from your workplace."

                "p": "Are there ways to prevent personal conflicts that could interfere with work? Should couples be allowed to hold hands at work, or should they maintain a professional relationship at all times while in the office? There is a lot that will need to be thought over. \nPublic displays of affection might not be widely accepted in the workplace as it can be deemed inappropriate, so that is also something that should be considered, especially in the Asian community. \nOther questions arise, such as whether there might be a need to ban employees in certain departments from dating if their jobs involve sensitive company information. \nThere is also the danger of a power imbalance between a superior and a junior employee in the same department, whether it could be favouritism in delegating certain tasks or assignments or potential sexual harassment allegations if the relationship goes south. There are many layers that we would need to peel. \nAt the end of the day, the decision comes from the top management. \nBefore companies make that decision, it’s important they think about the culture they want to build within their organisations. What would help with employee engagement? What would drive business growth? Of course, this is no easy decision but at the very least, companies must ensure they do not compromise their business operations. \nIn an ideal situation, companies would want to retain top talents and create a highly engaged workforce where everyone is valued and feel as if they are a part of a bigger family, but the reality of it is not as simple. What would your move be?"

Some MNEs may also be imposed a Minimum Effective Tax Rate of 15 per cent instead of current investment-friendlier rates and choose instead to relocate.\nWhile these are early days and Singapore would do well to observe the experience of other countries and the behaviour of MNEs, it is not inconceivable that GST will end up being the biggest tax revenue stream."

                "h2": "SHIFT TOWARDS TAXING CONSUMPTION NOT NEW",
                "p": "Regardless of whether GST eventually overtakes both CIT and PIT, there is a clear trend of shifting from income tax to consumption tax over the last decades.\nWhen Singapore was recovering from its first post-war recession back in 1986, one of the key recommendations of the 1986 Economic Committee, convened to respond to the recession and lead the nation to recovery, was to introduce GST and gradually increase GST revenue. \nThis would help Singapore be more competitive and attract investments, compared to the high 40 per cent CIT and top marginal PIT rate which were then slashed to sustain economic growth and create good jobs.\nOther economies have also undertaken similar tax reform, cutting income tax rates to increase attractiveness to international investments and manpower, and structuring their tax system to rely more on GST.\nFor example, Ireland’s standard corporate tax rate was phased down from 40 per cent in 1995 to 12.5 per cent today, while standard value-added tax (VAT) rate was increased from 21 per cent in 1995 to the current 23 per cent. VAT is generally the second highest revenue generator for Ireland, behind individual income tax.\nIn Singapore, GST rates were raised from the initial 3 per cent to 4 per cent in 2003, 5 per cent in 2004 and 7 per cent in 2007 for the same reasons.\nOne advantage of taxing consumption is that it allows more revenue to be collected at relatively low tax rates. Consumption also grows in tandem with the economy. Taxing consumption creates fewer distortions on people’s desire to work hard and save, and does not require people to file tax returns or run the risk of capital flight.\nOver the long term, GST offers a more stable revenue source, compared to income tax which is more directly affected by the state of the economy.\nRebalancing the tax mix is a fiscal policy priority. As Singapore’s average growth rates slow as its economy matures, reliance on pro-growth taxes like consumption and property taxes can avoid disincentivising work. OECD research also shows that a shift towards such less mobile taxes makes the tax system more resilient and less vulnerable to the effects of globalisation.\nAlthough Mr Wong has clarified that carbon taxes will not significantly add to government coffers, a shift towards such environmental taxes is also in line with the ethos of developed nations pricing in externalities when it comes to climate and health."

                "h2": "TAX BURDEN SHIFTED FROM BUSINESSES TO INDIVIDUALS?",
                "p": "With greater focus and reliance on GST, coupled with potential losses in CIT, does this mean Singapore’s tax burden is shifting from businesses to individuals?\nIt is tempting to come to this conclusion given that GST is a regressive consumption tax that affects most individuals.\nBut there is proactive targeted assistance to cushion the impact of GST and make the overall tax system fairer and progressive, ahead of the GST hike, including the permanent GST voucher scheme and the broader S$6.64 billion Assurance Package.\nIn fact, Singapore’s fiscal position actually shows that the largest contributor to our revenue does not come from tax, but the Net Investment Returns Contributions (NIRC) from our reserves. The NIRC in financial year 2021 was S$20.33 billion, larger than any tax revenue stream.\nSo perhaps, a fairer way to look at it is that Singapore and the Government need to generate a suitable source of revenue to fund its public expenditure.\nAnd broadening the tax base to tap more on more forms of taxes, including income tax and GST judiciously can keep it sustainable for our public spending needs in the long term."

                "p": "The middle and upper-middle income groups were impacted disproportionately compared to higher income groups who had access to creative tax planning and ingenuous new schemes, leading the Government to abolish it in 2008.\nWhile the issue may enjoy renewed and heated discussion, have the fundamentals changed for Singapore to revive estate duty? It doesn’t seem so. \nIn fact, many jurisdictions have similarly abolished such classes of taxes, including Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and New Zealand, to encourage overseas investors to hold assets in these places and promote their locations as attractive trust and asset management centres. \nLikewise, after Singapore removed it, our economy and society benefitted as both Singaporeans and foreigners were encouraged to invest and build up wealth and retain them in Singapore.

                "h2": "WHAT DOES A \"PURE\" WEALTH TAX LOOK LIKE?",
                "p": "In its purest form, wealth tax should be a tax on the net wealth of an individual, looking at the combined value of his or her assets - cash, properties, shares, luxury items and anything with a monetary value less any liabilities such as housing and car loans. \nIt is, however, challenging and administrative tedious to design such a means-tested system given that an individual’s assets and liabilities may fluctuate over time and it may be hard to assess their fair market values. \nThe fact that most assets – jewelleries, antiques, cash – are mobile and can be easily moved to another location will further complicate the mechanism to determine the tax base.\nCountries that have successfully implemented taxes on taxpayers’ net wealth include Switzerland and Norway. But the rates are modest, not exceeding 1 per cent for Switzerland and 0.8 per cent in Norway.\nStill, for efficiency and ease of administration, leveraging existing taxes like stamp duties and property taxes to increase rates for higher thresholds is preferred compared to creating a new confusing class of tax. "

                "h2": "TREADING CAREFULLY AROUND HIGH-NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS",
                "p": "Whichever route we take, calibrating the tax rates will be key to avoid impacting the attractiveness of Singapore’s wealth management industry – the biggest part of our financial service sector that has shifted towards catering to high-net worth individuals who also generate knock-on benefits for the economy.\nThere are at least 200 family offices managing around US$20 billion as of October 2020, after a five-fold increase between 2017 and 2019. They generate an entire ecosystem of jobs and demand in portfolio management, compliance, accountancy and other concierge services.\nWith Singapore’s bid to be investment friendly, we have attracted the likes of billionaire Ray Dalio and Haidilao founder Shu Ping to set up shop here.\nIn reviewing and expanding our system of wealth taxes, we must be clear about the objectives of raising a wealth tax.\nDPM Heng was quite clear at Budget 2021 in putting to bed the idea that raising wealth taxes can override the need to raise GST specifically to shore up reserves and the intent for a “one-off tax” like Argentina to shore up Singapore’s post-COVID-19 fiscal position.\nSo is it to address wealth disparity like what Mr Menon suggested in his Institute of Policy Studies lecture in July? Mr Wong’s words about the “rich paying their fair share” suggests moral principles are behind the taxes may be instructive.\nBut perhaps it would be useful for MOF to clarify where these new sources of government revenues will be going so the rich too can see how paying more taxes benefits society and what other programmes have been made possible with wealth taxes.\nWhatever form it takes, wealth taxes must not be set too punitively high nor thresholds too low such that the sandwiched class of taxpayers are affected disproportionately. \nA parting shot is this: Modest wealth taxes will not likely lead the ultra-wealthy individuals to relocate. After all, let’s not forget we have many favourable non-tax factors attracting foreign investors to relocate here and Singapore residents to stay put. \nThis includes an excellent education system, a safe country with low crime rates, a respected rule of law, a strategic location free from natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and typhoons and political stability, to name a few."
